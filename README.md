# Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

# Deployment

GitHub Pages only allows a web source to be either the root or <code>/docs</code> directory, so I've used <code>/docs</code> as a build output to trigger the Github Pages build/hosting feature.
